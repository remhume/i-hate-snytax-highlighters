i really do  
i won't even fix the typo in the repo name, it's hilarious


this is an attempt to create a syntax highlighting theme for atom that i find okay. i will base it on a style guide i created for university math scripts, which aren't at all like code. but i had a few ideas doing that which i want to use.

## Ideas (tbc)
* too many colours are shit and mainly irritate you. don't do that.
  * if the colours are not structuring but destructuring your code, they probably should be adjusted.
  * use such a small number of colours that you actually recognise them individually and they will actually _help_ you at coding. maybe a max of 4 or so. idk.
  * this also means the highlighting will be very personally adjusted to _me_ and how _i_ program and it will develop over time. fork for your own flavour.
* colours should have a more general meaning. like, not just one syntax thing, but maybe a group of things that have familiar associations.
  * this can probably be quite personal as well. i don't even know.
  * example: green means ~~clean.~~ definition. and maybe even assignments.
* if you associate meanings to colours: *use them!* this is a great way to help your mind, as it already has the right associations.

## FAQBM
(frequently asked questions by myself)

### when will you start actually making the thing?
idk. maybe tomorrow. or the day after. or next week. maybe not at all, if that's the case just feel inspired and fork this or do your own. i don't care.
### why are you using UK english?
idk. it felt appropriate for somehow ranting about shitty syntax highlighters.
